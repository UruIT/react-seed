# Contributing &middot; `react-seed`

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this *React Seed*.
Itâ€™s people like you that helps to spread the knowledge and make this repo such a great tool...

We are building it for people who want to learn more about these technologies.

In order to achieve this goal, we are keeping the main branch (`master`) as basic as possible.
* Only adding to it what we consider essential for starting projects. 
* And, leaving other features (more advanced ones) to the `seed/*` branches.

All these is also part of our second intention: avoid having an overwhelming amount of features/packages/configs.

We plan to incorporate a *Contributors* section on the `README` to say thank you for helping us!

## 1. Set up your environment

Read our documentation on [docs/setup](docs/setup.md).
Once you have the environment up and running, start playing around and build something new in top of it.

## 2. Create a Pull Request

If you like to contribute, submit a new *PR*. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

See README's [Coming up next](./README.md#Coming%20up%20next) section to get some ideas/features we want to incorporate.

You can also see our pull request template [here](docs/pull_request_template.md).

## 3. Report a Bug

Let us know if you found a bug, have some new ideas to include, etc.

See our issue template [here](docs/issue_template.md).
