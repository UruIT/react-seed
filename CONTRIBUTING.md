# Contributing &middot; `react-seed`

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this *React Seed*.
It’s people like you that helps to spread the knowledge and make this repo such a great tool...

We are building it for both, people who want to learn more about these technologies and teams starting new projects.

In order to achieve this goal, we are keeping the main branch (`master`) as basic as possible:
* Adding only what we consider essential for starting projects and newcomers to the *React* ecosystem. 
* Leaving other features (more advanced ones) to the `seed/*` branches. (read README's [Seed Branches](./README.md#seed-branches))

What we try to do is to have a simple seed, to fit most of the starting projects.
In our experience a lot of existing seeds have features we don’t need, and therefore we end up removing. 

All the contributors will be listed in the `README` to make public their help and express our gratitude.
